# FDM - SLA

# `P` common support area detection (fork new fdm code)
* `P` prioritize supports by length of unsupported span. mandatory when circularity > X
*     or % area of inner to outer poly is high (making it a thin shell)

# FDM - BELT

* `B` auto bed resizing leaves the origin in the wrong place at first
* `B` re-add progress calls for all work units

* `F` promote forced layer retraction to a range parameter
* `F` test and enable arcs in belt more
* `F` anchors should be generated anywhere needed in the print, not just head
* `F` slightly angle supports to lean into the Z of the part

# CAM

* `B` tab cuts cause loss of direction, parenting, depth, and it's hard to fix
* `B` tabs are not cut to exact height
* `B` tabs do not properly track widget mirror events
* `B` first rough step too far down in certain circumstances?
* `B` need to force cut line at synthetic z bottom (midlines, etc)
* `B` contour does not honor clip to stock

* `F` add `plunge max` to contouring that can override z feed limit
* `F` roughing flats should be constrained to flat region
* `F` limit cut depth to flute length of selected tool (or warn)
* `F` add ease-down support to trace op
* `F` change color of line selection in trace op when not a closed poly
* `F` add linear clearing strategy
* `F` add adaptive clearing strategy
* `F` user-defined origin (issue #28)
* `F` intelligently turn circle hole pocket clear into spiral down
* `F` trace follow hole that matches endmill should turn into a drill op
* `F` add climb/conventional into each operation
* `F` update analyzer to detect overhangs from faces, not slices
* `F` extend acute roughing on inside polys to clear small voids
* `F` option to use part / STL coordinate space to determine X,Y origin
* `F` validate muti-part layout and spacing exceeds largest outside tool diameter
* `F` polygon simplification option in tracing (for image derived maps)
* `F` parameterize dropping close points in prep.js. ensure long segments remain straight
* `F` flat and volumetric rendering of paths
* `F` z planar settings visualizations
* `F` convert acute angles to arcs to avoid jerk
* `F` lead-in milling
* `F` trapezoidal tabs in Z
* `F` ease-in and ease-out especially on tab cut-out start/stop
* `F` add option to spiral in vs out (optimal tool life) vs mixed (optimal path)
* `F` add support for tapered ball mills
* `F` can animation clear the mesh in areas where the cuts go through the stock?
* `F` support lathe mode / A-axis / rotary
* `F` gcode output option as zip for multiple or flip ops or tool change
* `F` maintain several part orientations + op chains in a single profile

* `P` port slicing to common core & refactor accordingly
* `P` decrease cutting speed when entire tool is engaged (start of roughing)
* `P` clear void should cut inside-to-out when a part would be freed from stock
* `P` port arc code from FDM export to CAM export
* `P` common part pre-analyze to speed up 'slice' and improve shadow (overhangs)
* `P` redo all path route / planning in prepare to account for terrain before camOut
* `P` allow faster z movements when contouring (not plunging)
* `P` common / faster shadow generator using vertices shared with ledges

# SLA

* `P` blit layers w/ 3JS ortho camera to canvas

# Laser

* `F` add PLT / HP-GL output format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-GL)

# OctoPrint plugin

* subfolder parameter for dropped files
* auto-kick check box in preferences


# Mesh:Tool

* send to Kiri:Moto workspace (or update model vertices in place)
* better z snap using just vertexes from face intersected
* add section view. local clip. raycast skip points above plane
* add isolate op = separate bodies
* add decimate op = face reduction
* add flatten/crush op: for z bottoms (or surfaces?)
* allow setting model/group origin for scale/rotate
* fix mirror to work with groups (just models currently)
* bounding box toggle should be global, not selection
* add analyze results dialog
* remove/hide auto-repair function
